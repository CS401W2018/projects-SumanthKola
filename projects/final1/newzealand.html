        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>Cricket came early to New Zealand. Anglican missionary Henry Williams organised a match in Northland in 1832, and the first match in which scores were recorded was played at Wellington in December 1842. In 1864 international cricket arrived in New Zealand in the form of George Parr's professional 'All-England Eleven', which had been playing in Melbourne. The English team won four matches against 22-strong teams representing Otago and Canterbury. By the late 19th century cricket had established itself as a major sporting code. There were thriving inter-club competitions in the main centres. In 1906 the Plunket Shield was presented by the governor, Lord Plunket, as the symbol of provincial supremacy. Teams played for the trophy on a challenge basis until the 1920-21 season, when it became a league competition. The original provinces of Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington were joined by Central Districts (in the 1950-51 season) and Northern Districts (in the 1956-57 season). The Plunket Shield was replaced by the Shell Trophy in the 1975-76 season, which was in turn succeeded by the State. <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/cricket-in-nz/why-cricket">New Zealand History Page.</a></p>

        <h3>Current New Zealand Team:</h3>
        <p>New Zealand are renowned for punching above their weight and being resourceful despite being among the least-populated Test-playing nations. They have won the inaugural World Test Championship (2021) and the ICC KnockOut Trophy, the predecessor to the Champions Trophy (2000), and have made it to the final of the 2015 and the 2019 ODI World Cups, along with four semi-finals and a final in their first eight T20 World Cup appearances. They are also the first team to whitewash India in India in a series of three or more Tests. In terms of history, the men's team played their first Test in 1930 but had to wait 26 years to register their first win. Their ascent in the '70s and '80s coincided with the career of Richard Hadlee, one of the greatest allrounders of all time and the first bowler to take 400 Test wickets. Martin Crowe, one of their greatest batters, also got among the ranks during the era, as the side developed a string of successful players, including John Wright, Lance Cairns, and Jeremy Coney. It allowed them get off to a stronger start in ODI cricket, as evidenced by their progress to the semi-finals in the first two World Cups. New Zealand were late to creating a fully professional system but it has allowed them to build successful teams thereafter, especially the ones led by Stephen Fleming, Brendon McCullum, and Kane Williamson, who is arguably their greatest batter of all time. McCullum's captaincy holds significance in terms of the culture and fearless style he brought to the side. New Zealand hold the records for the fastest Test hundred (off 54 balls by McCullum) and double-hundred (off 153 balls by Nathan Astle). They do not have a local franchise-based T20 league but have produced globetrotters like Trent Boult and James Neesham, and continue to adapt to the changing cricketing landscape. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/team/new-zealand-5"> ESPNcricinfo</a></p>
