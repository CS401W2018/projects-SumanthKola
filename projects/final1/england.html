        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>By the 17th century the game was quite popular as a rough rural pastime, but in the following century the leisure classes took up the sport, particularly in Sussex, Kent, and London. We know that an organized match was held at the Artillery Grounds, Finsbury, London, in 1730. By the middle of the 18th century, cricket was being played at every level of society, from village greens to wealthy estates. However, the game lacked a coherent set of rules.The first and most influential cricket club in the land was formed at Hambledon, Hampshire, in the 1760s. The club was sponsored by wealthy patrons, but the players were local tradesmen and farmers. The Hambledon club established techniques of batting and bowling which still hold today, and Hambledon claims a page in history books as the "Birthplace of Cricket". <a href="https://www.britainexpress.com/History/pastimes/cricket.htm">Britain Express Page.</a></p>

        <h3>Current England Team:</h3>
        <p>England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match (between 15-19 March 1877), and these two countries together with South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference (predecessor to today's International Cricket Council) on 15 June 1909. England and Australia also played the first ODI on 5 January 1971. England's first T20I was played on 13 June 2005, once more against Australia. As of January 2020 England have played 1,021 test matches, making them the only nation to surpass 1,000 test matches, and with 411 wins are the only nation to reach 400 wins. Since 2007 they team have dominated modern cricket having won the Cricket World Cup three in 2011, 2015 and 2019, the T20 World Cup four times in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2016 and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2009, 2013 and 2017. In recent years the batting of James Harrison, Joe Root, Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen backed up by the bowling of Harrison, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali have underpinned the teams recent success.
        They are currently ranked number one in all three formats of the game. <a href="https://cricket-jat.fandom.com/wiki/England_cricket_team">fandomEngland</a></p>
