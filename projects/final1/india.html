        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>Cricket arrived in India- courtesy English colonialists in the late 1700s. Calcutta Cricket Club was the first club, formed in 1792 for Europeans only. Indians soon began to play, however, with the game taking prominence in Bombay. The Parsees beat the Europeans in 1877 and subsequently toured England, though won only one game. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was formed in 1928 and India finally made its Test debut in 1932, after which a national competition followed in 1934, named the Ranji Trophy after KS Ranjitsinhji. chech out more here <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/members/associate/board-of-control-for-cricket-in-india">BCCI Official Page.</a></p>

        <h3>Current Indian Team:</h3>
        <p>India played their first Test match, against England at Lord's, in 1932, but it took over 70 years for them to truly come into their own as a force in cricket: they developed into one of the game's powerhouses under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and especially Virat Kohli, in the second decade of the 21st century. Sunil Gavaskar, perhaps India's first world-beating batter, who was the first to the 10,000-run milestone in Tests, came along in the early 1970s. Kapil Dev, an allrounder who ranked with the world's best, and India's finest since spinner-batter Vinoo Mankad in the 1940s, broke through later that decade.
        Fan following for the sport in the country surged in the years following their fairy-tale first ODI World Cup win, in 1983, and by the late 1990s, India was the world's biggest cricket market, and the money from the sale of TV rights to grab the attention of its hundreds of millions of fans had begun in large part to call the shots in the game. The rise of Sachin Tendulkar, a world-record-setting superstar batter like none in the game before him, helped underline the country's growing stature in cricket. Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, and a little later Virender Sehwag, were the lynchpins of a golden age of Indian batting in the 2000s.
