        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>Cricket arrived in India- courtesy English colonialists in the late 1700s. Calcutta Cricket Club was the first club, formed in 1792 for Europeans only. Indians soon began to play, however, with the game taking prominence in Bombay. The Parsees beat the Europeans in 1877 and subsequently toured England, though won only one game. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was formed in 1928 and India finally made its Test debut in 1932, after which a national competition followed in 1934, named the Ranji Trophy after KS Ranjitsinhji. chech out more here <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/members/associate/board-of-control-for-cricket-in-india">BCCI Official Page.</a></p>
