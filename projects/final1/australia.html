        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>The first central administrative body for cricket in Australia was established in March 1892, when delegates from the state associations of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria established the Australasian Cricket Council. The Council disbanded seven years later, and the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket was formed in 1905. Its first meeting was attended by two representatives from each of New South Wales and Victoria. A delegate from Queensland attended its second meeting later that year; and its constitution was amended in 1906 to formally allow for one representative from Queensland and three from each of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria.. chech out more here <a href="https://www.cricket.com.au/governing-the-game/ca-history">Australian Cricket.</a></p>

        <h3>Current Australian Team:</h3>
        <p>Australia faced England in the first ever Test, in 1877, and five years later the Ashes were born after Australia's unlikely win at The Oval. They have provided many of the game's greatest players since: from Donald Bradman and Victor Trumper to Shane Warne and Pat Cummins, the Chappell and Waugh brothers, the iconic bowling pair of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist, and the current generation of Steven Smith and David Warner. Australia have had numerous golden eras in Test and white-ball cricket. The first, at the turn of the 20th century, was followed by two either side of the Second World War, in which Bradman set batting records that will never be broken. The 1932-33 Ashes series involved the controversial Bodyline tactic of sustained short-pitched bowling, which led to a major diplomatic incident. After the war, in 1948, the Australian "Invincibles" side went through the tour of England unbeaten. In the late 1970s the game globally was torn apart by World Series Cricket, TV mogul Kerry Packer's breakaway league, before a truce that revolutionised the broadcasting of the game and player remuneration. Under Allan Border, on-field fortunes were turned around in the late 1980s, and in 1994-95, led by Mark Taylor, they unofficially became the best team in the world, beating West Indies in the Caribbean. By then Warne was a central figure in the game. Over the next decade, he was mesmeric, becoming the first bowler to reach both 600 and 700 Test wickets, and forming one of the great bowling pairings with Glenn McGrath. Twice Australia have put together record runs of 16 Test wins in a row: under Steve Waugh in 1999-2000 and Ponting in 2006-07. For a period in the early 2000s they were rarely toppled in Tests or ODIs, although they lost the 2005 Ashes 2-1 in what is considered one of the great series. In 2018 the game was rocked by a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa but in recent years another era of dominance has emerged under Cummins, who led them to the World Test Championship title in 2022.
