            <p> <div class = "fontsize"> Kick Buttowski is an animated disney show which used to aired in Disney XD channel. I grew up watching this show and I absolutely loved it. This is one of my favorite shows because of it's action, friendship, message of persistence, and hillaious comedy. </p>
            <p> Basically, this show is about a kid who wants to be the daredevil in the whole world by constantly breaking the world records at stunts with stake board which includes a lot of risk. Although, his own brother Brad who keeps taunting him and discourage him, Kick keeps pushing himself to reach his goals. And the amazing friendship with his friend Gunther who's always there to help him with the stunts and also create self-worth.</div></p>
