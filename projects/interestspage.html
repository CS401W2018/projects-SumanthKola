        <p> It is the no.1 popular sport in India and no.2 in the world. Although it is not famous in the American continents but it is in rest of the world. 
            I love this sport because this game is unique unlike other sports which have two courts. This is also a mind game and includes a lot of physical reflexes.

        <p> I played a lot of cricket growing up in India. I started when I was very young with my cousins and friends at school. I played cricket for my school at sports meet which happens once a year. 
            And even now the Indian community at BYUH we play at PCC ground and sometimes at Kahuku baseball field.
