        <h2>Engagment Assignment</h2>
        <p> 1. Block-level tags take up the full width available and always start on a new line. They typically contain other block or inline elements. Inline tags only take up as much width as needed and do not start on a new line. These are typically used for text formatting within block-level elements.</p>
        <p>2. Normal flow refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements. Block elements stack vertically from top to bottom, while inline elements flow horizontally within their containing block. </p>
        <p>3. Float allows elements to be positioned to the left or right of their containing element, with other content flowing around them. Clearing the float is necessary to avoid layout issues. </p>
        <p>4. Relative Positioning: Positions an element relative to its normal flow location.Absolute Positioning: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Positions an element relative to the browser window, regardless of scrolling. </p>
        <p>5. Use nav button to design the padding, good contrast of font and background color and flexible widths.</p>
