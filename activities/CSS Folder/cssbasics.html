        <p> I've got a list of the things I've done wrong, All the pain that I bore for so long.
            Justice was holding the cards,Mercy seemed so far. <p>
        <p>Then You stepped in between me and my fate,Took a pen to the charges I should pay.
            Right on the dotted line,You signed Your name over mine.</p>
