        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
        <p> I've got a list of the things I've done wrong, All the pain that I bore for so long.
            Justice was holding the cards,Mercy seemed so far. <p>
        <p>Then You stepped in between me and my fate,Took a pen to the charges I should pay.
            Right on the dotted line,You signed Your name over mine.</p>
        <h1>Engagment Assignment</h1>
        <h2>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Inline css goes in main tag withing p tags along with the paragraphs. Embedded css goes in head tag at the beginnin of the code separate from the paragrapgs. External css goes in a different .css file outside of the original file which is linked to the file using link:css   </p>
        <h2>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>This is for the graphic designer to develop the page into styles by not touching the html coding.</p>
        <h2>What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p>This is used to highlight the specific paragraphs within the code.</p>
