        <p>1. Cricket Sport - Champion's Trophy! </p>
        <p>2. I love the sport cricket and there's an upcoming champion's trophy tournament happening in early 2025 so I want to bring the news to the website I'll create and have the schedule there. All the information will be on this website regarding the event. </p>
        <p>3. For homepage I'll have all the teams pictures and brief history of the sport. And for each pages of 5 I will have top 5 teams competiting and how likely there are to win.   </p>
        <p>4. For the form I'll take their personal information and their vote for their team. In one of the pages I'll have the table which includes the cricket matches time, place and the teams.</p>
        <p>5. For the events schedules I will collect the information from the official cricket page where you can use that information. I will also use my own personal knowledge about cricket to write a brief history of it in the homepage. I will use my own photos of me playing cricket and also, use pixels free images too.</p>
        <p>6. I have read the warning in the assignments and I understood them!</p>
